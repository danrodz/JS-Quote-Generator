# Simple-JS-Quote-Generator
A basic quote generator with vanilla JS that displays 3 different types of sentences, from arrays of options. 

It currently displays in the console, and it has an interactive loop that allows user to request more randomly constructed sentences by calling the function expression, which takes two inputs: 

1: the type of sentence structure, 

2: the number of quotes requested. 

The loop will continue to request additional number of quotes generated until an invalid number is submitted or user selects 'cancel' from the prompt window.
